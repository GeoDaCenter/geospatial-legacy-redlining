Howard received an allegedly anonymous tip that the Lowman family was selling whiskey.  Accompanied by three deputies, the sheriff made his way to the Lowman home armed, supposedly, with a legal search warrant to investigate.  As the four plainly dressed men approached the home, Sam Lowman, the black sharecropper who owned the home and surrounding farm, was away having cornmeal ground at the local mill.  His wife, Annie, and daughter, Bertha, were at work either inside the house or in the yard nearby.  Shortly after the law enforcement officers arrived, Lowman’s son, Demon, and nephew, Clarence, who had been plowing a field some one hundred yards away, ran to the house to assist the family members inside.  In the brief moments that followed, gunshots were exchanged.  Demon, Bertha, and Clarence were shot, and Sheriff Howard and Annie Lowman died. The three Lowman children, and two other family members were arrested and all five were promptly tried on charges of murder.  Demon, Clarence, and Bertha were each convicted.  The fourteen-year-old Clarence and his cousin Demon were sentenced to die and Bertha was sentenced to life in prison. Sam Lowman received a two-year sentence on the chain gang.  Later that month, N.J. Frederick, one of the only African American lawyers in SC and a leading NAACP official, defended the Lowmans and convinced the state Supreme Court to order a new trial.  On October 5, 1926, he won a directed verdict of “not guilty” for Demon Lowman and had poked holes in the cases against Clarence and Bertha. After the trial, Demon was arrested on new charges and the three Lowman youths were returned to the Aiken jail.  In the early morning hours, a white mob, assisted by Aiken deputies, removed them from the jail and drove them to an old tourist camp outside of Aiken where a large crowd had gathered.  After being ordered to line up and run, they were shot down by members of the mob.  Despite national outrage, the killers were never brought to justice.\n\nSource: Peter Lau, Democracy Rising: South Carolina and the Fight for Black Equality since 1865 (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 2006), 58-59.

National protests, led by anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells and George White, the last remaining Black Reconstruction-era Congressman, forced the federal government to investigate.  Thirteen men were arraigned and charged with conspiracy to violate Baker’s civil rights under the Enforcement Acts.

It was called \"The Revolution of 1888.\"  The group of white who forced them to leave stated:\n\n\"God damn you, you‘ve got to leave this county, this is a white man‘s government, and we are tired of negro dominance; we have been planning this for the past two years, and not more Negroes or Republicans shall hold office in this county.\"\n\nAt that time (in 1888), Republicans were the party of Lincoln and Democrats were the party of white supremacy, redemption from \"Negro Rule\", the Ku Klux Klan, and the White League, the Rifle Clubs, Red Shirts, or Knights of the White Camellia (other white supremacist groups).\n\nWhen whites in Marion expelled Black leaders at gunpoint, it was right before the fall elections, so this resulted in the complete loss of Black political power and the complete rise of white power.  Not only were Black elected officials expelled at gunpoint, but so were prominent Black citizens. After this was complete, white Democrats passed the Election Law of 1891, a poll tax, secret ballots, and eventually the all-white primary (in 1905) which helped nullify the voting power of the super Black majority in Crittenden County.\n\nThis is how Black political power and representation was destroyed after Reconstruction in Crittenden County.

When their leadership informed them that they were breaking protocol by carrying these weapons they stowed them nearby, some in a dilapidated vestry building on the premises and others in a stand of woods.\n\nThe meeting commenced with a speech from the Democratic candidate for prosecuting attorney of the circuit, who was followed by W.J. McKinlay, a prominent Republican politician.  Shortly after McKinlay began speaking several young men from the Democratic congregation entered the old vestry and discovered the cache of weapons stored there.  They emerged from the structure and shouted warning to their comrades while McKinlay issued a similar warning to his fellow Republicans.  Seeing armed Democrats emerge from the vestry, many of the Republicans rushed to gather the weapons that they had stored in the nearby woods.  The scene quickly devolved into chaos as both sides feared the worst intentions from the other.  In the opening melee one elderly African American man was shot dead.  After this initial casualty the bulk of the Republican group returned from the woods with their weapons and quickly outflanked the Democrat’s position.  Many of the Democrats on the scene had carried sidearms to the meeting and returned fire, but they were ultimately driven from the field.  Between three and six of the white Democrats fell dead on the field before the firing ceased.

They succeeded in driving off their assailants, and retired to their own quarters.\n\nThe negroes immediately collected reinforcements, and, to the number of fifteen or twenty, advanced toward the scene of the first conflict. They were met near the same spot by a still larger party of Irishmen, armed with pistols and clubs, and, after a sharp fight, were discomfited, cut off from their quarters, and forced back to Mrs. Carter’s farm. Here they obtained further help, and then endeavored to save the cabins of the first party, which had been already attacked by their assailants. The Irish, better armed and more numerous, fired upon them across a deep cut and drove them off. The abandoned cabins were pillaged, and the money which the poor fellows had received the day before, and which was mostly deposited in sachels left in the quarters, was stolen. The Irishmen then fired the cabins, and immediately got into a row among themselves, during which one of the number, named Colls, was killed, and his body left near the cabins.\n\nDuring the night the Irishmen collected reinforcements, and next morning renewed the fight. By spreading the report that Colls had been murdered by the negroes, they roused their countrymen to the utmost frenzy, and a party of about 150 made an attack on the Negroes on Mrs. Carter’s farm just at daybreak.\n\nRoused from sleep by the firing, the poor fellows fled in terror and confusion, closely pursued by the infuriated Irishmen. One of the negroes, Denis Powell, was shot, and left dying by the road. A portion of the fugitives sought refuge in the out-buildings around Mrs. Carter’s house, under the porch, and elsewhere about the premises. The Irish demanded admission to the house, and when the brave woman refused, they beat in the door. Just at that moment a poor old Negro was discovered crouching under the porch. He was immediately shot, dragged out, and beaten to death with clubs. After searching the premises, and finding no one, they retired. On their way back they found Powell still alive, and falling upon him, beat out his brains with clubs and stones. Spying another fugitive, Oscar Bruce, in the act of climbing a fence, they shot him down, and then, jumping upon his prostrate form, stamped it and beat it with clubs until it was unrecognizable as the remains of a human being.\n\n(more info: http:\/\/chroniclingamerica.loc.gov\/lccn\/sn83030272\/1872-09-28\/ed-1\/seq-1\/#date1=1836&index=3&rows=20&words=PATENBURG+Patenburg&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1922&proxtext=%22patenburg%22&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1)", "Source": "http:\/\/blackhistory.harpweek.com\/7Illustrations\/Reconstruction\/PatenburgMassacre.htm", "Overflow": null, "lon": -75.00962, "lat": 40.65843 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -75.00962, 40.65843 ] } },
