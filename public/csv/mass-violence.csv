For a short time there was quiet on the main street of the village until some one was reported to have suggested that negroes spending Saturday night in Princess Anne be run out of town.

Lowman Lynchings,"Aiken, South Carolina",25-Apr-1925,"4","1","On April 25, 1925, Aiken sheriff H.H. Howard received an allegedly anonymous tip that the Lowman family was selling whiskey.  Accompanied by three deputies, the sheriff made his way to the Lowman home armed, supposedly, with a legal search warrant to investigate.  As the four plainly dressed men approached the home, Sam Lowman, the black sharecropper who owned the home and surrounding farm, was away having cornmeal ground at the local mill.  His wife, Annie, and daughter, Bertha, were at work either inside the house or in the yard nearby.  Shortly after the law enforcement officers arrived, Lowman’s son, Demon, and nephew, Clarence, who had been plowing a field some one hundred yards away, ran to the house to assist the family members inside.  In the brief moments that followed, gunshots were exchanged.  Demon, Bertha, and Clarence were shot, and Sheriff Howard and Annie Lowman died. The three Lowman children, and two other family members were arrested and all five were promptly tried on charges of murder.  Demon, Clarence, and Bertha were each convicted.  The fourteen-year-old Clarence and his cousin Demon were sentenced to die and Bertha was sentenced to life in prison. Sam Lowman received a two-year sentence on the chain gang.  Later that month, N.J. Frederick, one of the only African American lawyers in SC and a leading NAACP official, defended the Lowmans and convinced the state Supreme Court to order a new trial.  On October 5, 1926, he won a directed verdict of “not guilty” for Demon Lowman and had poked holes in the cases against Clarence and Bertha. After the trial, Demon was arrested on new charges and the three Lowman youths were returned to the Aiken jail.  In the early morning hours, a white mob, assisted by Aiken deputies, removed them from the jail and drove them to an old tourist camp outside of Aiken where a large crowd had gathered.  After being ordered to line up and run, they were shot down by members of the mob.  Despite national outrage, the killers were never brought to justice.

During the protest, students lit a bonfire in the heart of the campus and continued to loudly call for change. Meanwhile, officers from the South Carolina highway patrol and National Guard soldiers moved towards campus. Later that evening, highway patrolmen converged on the campus to disperse the crowd and enable local firefighters to douse the flames. Accounts differ on what happened next but shortly after their arrival, the patrolmen opened fire on the students killing three and wounding twenty-seven.  Nine patrolmen were arrested and put on trial. All were acquitted. The only individual arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for his supposed role in the massacre was Cleveland Sellers, a longtime civil rights activist and former field organizer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

With the escort of reluctant police officers, it turned out to be the most brutal march I had ever been involved in. In fact, when we returned to our cars, we saw several pushed into the lagoon and others that were set on fire, turned over or damaged in some way. Ironically, there were only three cars not damaged. One was mine, and the other two were the police cars I had parked between.

Lynching of Frazier Baker,"Lake City, South Carolina",22-Feb-1898,"2","6","Shortly before one o’clock on the morning of February 22, 1898, Frazier Baker, an African-American postmaster in the predominantly white hamlet of Lake City, South Carolina, awoke to discover a raging fire deliberately set in back of the small wooden structure that housed both his family and the town’s post office.  Caught between the rising flames and a group of hostile and well-armed white men outside the building, Baker, his wife, and their six children sought unsuccessfully to douse the blaze.  As they prepared to flee the post office, the mob opened fire.  The postmaster was shot several times and collapsed, fatally wounded.  The barrage of gunfire continued unabated, and the three eldest Baker children were all seriously injured before they could escape through the open door into the night.  Baker’s wife Lavinia attempted to follow with her infant daughter Julia, but a bullet passed through her hand, killing the baby and tearing her from her mother’s arms.  Struck in the leg by a second bullet, Lavinia Baker collapsed beside the burning building.  The mob then dispersed as quietly as it had appeared.  As flames consumed the wooden structure, local African Americans drawn by the gunfire offered sanctuary in their homes to the new widow and her five surviving children. National protests, led by anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells and George White, the last remaining Black Reconstruction-era Congressman, forced the federal government to investigate.  Thirteen men were arraigned and charged with conspiracy to violate Baker’s civil rights under the Enforcement Acts. Local whites, however, obstructed justice through perjury and appeals to the racial sensibilities of jurors. The result was a mistrial.

""How long do you expect to remain in this county and live?""

He then went to Taylor County, adjoining Lafayette on the west, but was again driven out. While preaching at night twenty white men came in and stationed themselves about the pulpit.

""It was our first object lesson in the doctrine of white supremacy; an illustration of the South's cardinal principle no matter what the attainments, character or standing of an Afro-American, the laws of the South will not protect him against a white man. There was only one thing we could do, and a great determination seized the people to follow the advice of the martyred Moss, and ""turn our faces to the West,"" whose laws protect all alike. The Free Speech supported ministers and leading business men advised the people to leave a community whose laws did not protect them. Hundreds left on foot to walk four hundred miles between Memphis and Oklahoma. A Baptist minister went to the territory, built a church, and took his entire congregation out in less than a month. Another minister sold his church and took his flock to California, and still another has settled in Kansas. In two months, six thousand persons had left the city and every branch of business began to feel this silent resentment of the outrage, and failure of the authorities to punish lynchers.

Crittenden County Coup D'Etat,"Crittenden County, Arkansas",7-Dec-1888,unknown,Unknown,"In Crittenden County, Arkansas, Reconstruction ended when racist white Democrats in Marion forcibly expelled African American elected officials (County Judge Daniel Lewis, County Clerk David Ferguson, County Assessor J.R. Rooks and Arkansas State Representative Sandy S. Odom) at gunpoint of 50 Winchester rifles on July 12,1888.  It was called ""The Revolution of 1888.""  The group of white who forced them to leave stated:

""God damn you, you‘ve got to leave this county, this is a white man‘s government, and we are tired of negro dominance; we have been planning this for the past two years, and not more Negroes or Republicans shall hold office in this county.""

At that time (in 1888), Republicans were the party of Lincoln and Democrats were the party of white supremacy, redemption from ""Negro Rule"", the Ku Klux Klan, and the White League, the Rifle Clubs, Red Shirts, or Knights of the White Camellia (other white supremacist groups).

When whites in Marion expelled Black leaders at gunpoint, it was right before the fall elections, so this resulted in the complete loss of Black political power and the complete rise of white power.  Not only were Black elected officials expelled at gunpoint, but so were prominent Black citizens. After this was complete, white Democrats passed the Election Law of 1891, a poll tax, secret ballots, and eventually the all-white primary (in 1905) which helped nullify the voting power of the super Black majority in Crittenden County.

This is how Black political power and representation was destroyed after Reconstruction in Crittenden County. It is clear from the historical record that Black people in Crittenden County did have political power, but through, terrorism, and taking the law into their hands, white people in Crittenden County stole African American's birthright.

Cainhoy Riots,"Cainhoy, South Carolina",16-Oct-1876,6+,unknown,"On October 16, 1876 a joint political meeting took place near Cainhoy, South Carolina, a small town located approximately nine miles northeast of Charleston.  A group of about one-hundred and fifty Democrats traveled to the site by steamboat and met their political opponents at “Brick Church.”  The leadership from both sides had agreed beforehand that participants would not bear arms at the meeting, but many of the Republicans, mindful of the sort of violence that had occurred previously in places like Hamburg, arrived to the meeting with their personal firearms.  When their leadership informed them that they were breaking protocol by carrying these weapons they stowed them nearby, some in a dilapidated vestry building on the premises and others in a stand of woods.

The meeting commenced with a speech from the Democratic candidate for prosecuting attorney of the circuit, who was followed by W.J. McKinlay, a prominent Republican politician.  Shortly after McKinlay began speaking several young men from the Democratic congregation entered the old vestry and discovered the cache of weapons stored there.  They emerged from the structure and shouted warning to their comrades while McKinlay issued a similar warning to his fellow Republicans.  Seeing armed Democrats emerge from the vestry, many of the Republicans rushed to gather the weapons that they had stored in the nearby woods.  The scene quickly devolved into chaos as both sides feared the worst intentions from the other.  In the opening melee one elderly African American man was shot dead.  After this initial casualty the bulk of the Republican group returned from the woods with their weapons and quickly outflanked the Democrat’s position.  Many of the Democrats on the scene had carried sidearms to the meeting and returned fire, but they were ultimately driven from the field.  Between three and six of the white Democrats fell dead on the field before the firing ceased.  Members of Democratic controlled rifle clubs from Charleston quickly organized and arrived on the scene in force within a few hours.  Tensions remained high, but no more organized fighting took place and a small detachment of U.S. military forces arrived a few days later in order to maintain the tenuous peace.

During the search, two African Americans were murdered and sporadic firefights took place between Tennant’s supporters and his pursuers.  Eventually, Tennant surrendered.  Shortly afterwards, Governor Chamberlain ordered the disarming of the militia and the disbanding of all other paramilitary groups in the county.  Tensions remained high; Later that year, following the death of a white woman (Lena Foster), six black men were arrested but were lynched by a mob of several hundred white men who removed them from the sheriff’s office.

Patenburg Massacre,"Musconetcong Mountain, Hunterdon County, New Jersey",21-Sep-1872,4+,150+,"The white laborers appear to have drank a good deal of whisky; whether the Negroes did is not known. Late in the evening a party of the latter went to the village on a serenading expedition, and on their return fell in with a party of Irish laborers, by whom they were violently assaulted. They succeeded in driving off their assailants, and retired to their own quarters.

The negroes immediately collected reinforcements, and, to the number of fifteen or twenty, advanced toward the scene of the first conflict. They were met near the same spot by a still larger party of Irishmen, armed with pistols and clubs, and, after a sharp fight, were discomfited, cut off from their quarters, and forced back to Mrs. Carter’s farm. Here they obtained further help, and then endeavored to save the cabins of the first party, which had been already attacked by their assailants. The Irish, better armed and more numerous, fired upon them across a deep cut and drove them off. The abandoned cabins were pillaged, and the money which the poor fellows had received the day before, and which was mostly deposited in sachels left in the quarters, was stolen. The Irishmen then fired the cabins, and immediately got into a row among themselves, during which one of the number, named Colls, was killed, and his body left near the cabins.

During the night the Irishmen collected reinforcements, and next morning renewed the fight. By spreading the report that Colls had been murdered by the negroes, they roused their countrymen to the utmost frenzy, and a party of about 150 made an attack on the Negroes on Mrs. Carter’s farm just at daybreak.

Roused from sleep by the firing, the poor fellows fled in terror and confusion, closely pursued by the infuriated Irishmen. One of the negroes, Denis Powell, was shot, and left dying by the road. A portion of the fugitives sought refuge in the out-buildings around Mrs. Carter’s house, under the porch, and elsewhere about the premises. The Irish demanded admission to the house, and when the brave woman refused, they beat in the door. Just at that moment a poor old Negro was discovered crouching under the porch. He was immediately shot, dragged out, and beaten to death with clubs. After searching the premises, and finding no one, they retired. On their way back they found Powell still alive, and falling upon him, beat out his brains with clubs and stones. Spying another fugitive, Oscar Bruce, in the act of climbing a fence, they shot him down, and then, jumping upon his prostrate form, stamped it and beat it with clubs until it was unrecognizable as the remains of a human being.

Chester County was a hotbed of Klan activity throughout the early 1870s, as Klansmen acted as the “terrorist arm of the Democratic party” and performed countless acts of intimidation and violence to prevent African Americans from exercising their political rights.  The most notable incident was the Chester Riot of 1871, where Klansmen and African American militia exchanged gunfire near a rail depot in Rock Hill. Following several days of battle, both sides agreed to a temporary truce.  Governor Scott responded to the incident by ordering all militia companies in the vicinity disarmed, which effectively removed any opposition to Klan activity.

Opelousas Massacre,"Opelousas, Louisiana",28-Sep-1868,100-300,unknown,"""The Opelousas massacre occurred in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, on September 28, 1868. It centered around Emerson Bentley, a white editor for a local newspaper called The Landry Progress and an influential schoolteacher who promoted the education of black children. Bentley wrote an article that local members of the Seymour Knights, a branch unit of the white supremacist group The Knights of the White Camellia, deemed offensive. The backlash to the article led three men to take the attempt to intimidate and severely cane Bentley, causing him to flee St. Landry. Local blacks were told that Bentley had been murdered and banded together to retaliate. While marching towards Opelousas with arms in hand, efforts were made to inform the freedmen that Bentley had not been murdered but escaped; causing some of the men to retreat, while others continued to march.

The freedmen were met by armed whites determined to defend their town. Shooting occurred by both sides and twenty-nine black prisoners were captured. On September 29, all of the captured prisoners, with the exception of two men, were taken from the prison and executed. The violence at Opelousas continued for weeks to come. The death toll of the massacre resulted in some controversy. Three white Radical Republicans and two Democrats were killed in the assault. Republicans stated that around 200-300 blacks where killed whereas the Democrats denied this claim as fraudulent and stated that only twenty-five to thirty were killed. Historians today have deduced that the Republicans were more correct in their number range.""",http://goo.gl/3w3ty8,,-92.081509,30.5335302

"Millican ""Riot""","Millican, Texas",19-Aug-1868,2-100,Unknown,"The Millican Race Riot of 1868 was arguably largest “race riot” in Texas.

""The conflict occurred in Millican, Texas, a town located 15 miles from the Texas A&M University campus.

Details remain unclear, but we believe that the Klan marched through Millican, a small central Texas town on the Houston and Central Texas Railroad, on during a Sunday church service led by Pastor George Brooks, a local Methodist preacher, former Union soldier, and Union League organizer. The worshiping armed freedmen fired on the rally, driving the Klan out of town. After the rally, George Brooks began a black militia of about 200 townspeople. The white community asked Nathan H. Randlett, local agent of the Freeman’s Bureau and former union infantry Captain, to stop the militia action, but Randlett refused.

Several confrontations occurred including the rumors of attempted lynchings. Some papers report that Miles Brown, a freedman, was rumored to be lynched, others that Andrew (or his brother William) Halliday or Holiday, a white son of a former large plantation owner, the target due to his supposed lynching of Brown. Several confrontations occurred including a march on the larger county seat of Bryan by a large group of armed blacks, which ended in an armed assault on the local black community and deaths of numerous black women, children, and men. Brooks was apparently tortured and killed. It is unclear if his body was recovered.

Apparently the local authorities called for a militia to be formed in Bryan and sent by train to put down the “mob.” Newspapers describe the militia as being taken from the bars and brothels in the middle of the day. Newspapers also report that the black militia surrounded the local black community, patrolling the edges of the area to protect the citizens.""",https://millican.omeka.net/about,,-96.2024593,30.4685377

","Solomon George Washington Dill was a native of Kershaw, South Carolina and an active member of the Republican Party in the early days of Reconstruction.  After serving as a delegate to the state Constitutional Convention of 1868, Dill won a seat in the SC House of Representatives in April of that same year.  After serving only a few months in office, Dill was induced to run for county commissioner.  During the campaign, Dill suffered much abuse in the local press and received several threats on his life.  As a result, he asked several close friends to stand guard at his home on nights leading up to the June elections.  On the evening of June 4, 1868, however, the Dill homestead was left unguarded.  Eleven men crept quietly towards the home; Four of these men stopped along the road to ambush any of the legislator’s allies who might have come to his defense.  The remaining seven men reached Dill’s house and killed the legislator and Nester Ellison, an elderly man who kept watch over the home.  Dill’s wife was reportedly wounded. Whether she died is unknown. Over twenty individuals were arrested by military authorities in connection with the crime but despite a large amount of circumstantial evidence and witness testimony, none were convicted. Democratic Party officials continued such acts of intimidation to scare African Americans out of voting Republican.
